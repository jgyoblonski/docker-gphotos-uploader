This repository contains the _Dockerfiles_ and all other files needed to create and run a container with a background task to mass upload media folders to your [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) account. The task runs periodically on a predefined schedule and is powered by [`gphotos-uploader-cli`](https://github.com/nmrshll/gphotos-uploader-cli).

## Supported Architectures

This image supports multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. Simply pulling `rfgamaral/gphotos-uploader` should retrieve the correct image for your architecture, but you can always pull specific architecture images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |

## Usage

### Create and start the container

Make sure the Docker daemon is running and then start the container like this:

```
docker run -d \
    --name=gphotos-uploader \
    -e GPU_SCHEDULE="0 */8 * * *" \
    -v <PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION>:/config \
    -v <PATH_TO_PHOTOS_LIBRARY>:/photos \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    rfgamaral/gphotos-uploader
```

Once the container is running and before `gphotos-uploader-cli` is able to work properly, you'll need to first edit the `/config/config.hsjon` and set your `APIAppCredentials` according to the [Authentication](#authentication) section below. Please refer to the official [documentation](https://github.com/nmrshll/gphotos-uploader-cli/blob/master/.docs/configuration.md) for all other configuration options.

### Container configuration parameters

Please refer to the following table for all available configuration paramaters that can be passed at run-time to container images:

| Parameter | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `-e GPU_SCHEDULE="0 */8 * * *"` | Background task schedule expression (defaults to every 8 hours).<br>See [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) for help with the schedule expression. |
| `-v <PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION>:/config` | Absolute host path to store `gphotos-uploader-cli` configuration. |
| `-v <PATH_TO_PHOTOS_LIBRARY>:/photos` | Absolute host path for the photos library source folder. |

## Authentication

Given that `gphotos-uploader-cli` uses OAuth 2 to access Google APIs, authentication is a bit tricky and envolves a few manual steps. Please follow the guide below carefully, to give `gphotos-uploader-cli` the required access to your Google Photos account.

### API credentials

Before you can use `gphotos-uploader-cli`, you must enable the Photos Library API and request an OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

1. Make sure you're logged in into the Google Account where your photos should be uploaded to.
2. Start by [creating a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) in Google Cloud Platform and give it a name (example: _Google Photos Uploader_).
3. Enable the [Google Photos Library API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/photoslibrary.googleapis.com) by clicking the <kbd>ENABLE</kbd> button.
4. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) by setting the application name (example: _docker-gphotos-uploader_) and then click the <kbd>Save</kbd> button on the bottom.
5. Create [credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) by clicking the **Create credentials â†’ OAuth client ID** option, then pick **Other** as the application type and give it a name (example: _gphotos-uploader-cli_).
6. Copy the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** and keep them ready to use in the next section.

### CLI authentication

Once an OAuth 2.0 Client ID is generated, authenticating `gphotos-uploader-cli` against your Google Account is required for proper access to your Google Photos account.

_The following steps assume the container has been created and it's running. If not, please refer to the [create and start the container](#create-and-start-the-container) section above before continuing._

1. Open the `/config/config.hsjon` file and set both the `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` options to the ones generated on the previous section and your the `jobs[0].account` option to the Google Account e-mail address where your photos should be uploaded to.
2. Open your favorite terminal and run the following command to start the authentication process:

    ```
    docker exec -it gphotos-uploader oauth.sh start
    ```

3. You should get an output similiar to this one:

    ```
    2019/02/05 09:22:23 Error finding credential
    2019/02/05 09:22:23 Need to log login into account <ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
    2019/02/05 09:22:25 You will now be taken to your browser for authentication or open the url below in a browser.
    2019/02/05 09:22:25 https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=<API_CLIENT_ID>&login_hint=<ACCOUNT_EMAIL>&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A14565%2Foauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fphotoslibrary&state=<STATE>
    2019/02/05 09:22:25 If you are opening the url manually on a different machine you will need to curl the result url on this machine manually.
    2019/02/05 09:22:26 Failed to open browser, you MUST do the manual process.
    2019/02/05 09:22:26 Authentication will be cancelled in 120 seconds
    ```

    Open the the authentication URL in your main browser and allow _docker-gphotos-uploader_ access to your Google Account to "View and manage your Google Photos library".
4. You're now supposed to be redirected to a page that **will not load**. You'll get a message like "unable to connect" or "this site can't be reached", depending on your browser. Worry not, just copy the URL from the browser address bar and run the following command on a **new terminal** window:

    ```
    docker exec -it gphotos-uploader oauth.sh store-token "<URL_COPIED_FROM_ADDRESS_BAR>"
    ```

    _Please notice the double quotes surrounding the URL, do not remove these._

5. Once the previous step is done, you should've got the following output on your **first terminal** window:

    ```
    2019/02/05 09:37:41 stored token for user: <ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
    2019/02/05 09:37:41 Shutting down server...
    Server gracefully stopped
    ```

The authentication process is now complete and and `gphotos-uploader-cli` is ready to run upload your photos on the background.
